## Installation 

1. Clone and `cd` into this git repo
2. Make `build_install.sh` executable by running `chmod +x build_install.sh` in bash terminal  
3. In terminal, run `./build_install.sh` to build and install the package  
4. To ensure a clean start, run:  

```bash
rm -f src/*.o src/*.so  
rm -rf wispack.Rcheck  
rm -f wispack_*.tar.gz  
./build_install.sh
```

### Linux
On Linux (Ubuntu/Debian), additional system dependencies are required *before* the building process: 
- `libxml2` for roxygen2
- `r-base-dev`, `libnlopt-dev` (or `libnlopt-cxx-dev`) for Rcpp, RcppEigen, and StanHeaders

For PDF documentation generation, `pdflatex` should also be installed

```bash
sudo apt install \
    libxml2 \
    r-base-dev \
    libnlopt-dev \
    libnlopt-cxx-dev \
    texlive-latex-base \
    texlive-fonts-recommended \
    texlive-fonts-extra \
    texlive-latex-extra
```


## Demos

```R
demo("quick_start", package = "wispack")  
demo("full_options", package = "wispack")
```


## Dependency licenses

NOTE: The GPLv2 of Rcpp and the Apache 2.0 of the oneTBB compiled with Stan are incompatible when bundled together as a single binary, which is why these scripts are being provided as a buildable R package on GitHub but not as a precompiled binary ready for installation.
